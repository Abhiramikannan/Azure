Monitoring:
    Created a new Resource Group (RG).
    Created a VNet with a private subnet.
    NSG added directly to VMs (not subnets).
    Created a VM attached to a public subnet with a public security group.
    Gained access to the VM, set permissions for the pem file (chmod 400 pemfile).
    installed docker
    ran Nginx in a container (docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx).

network watcher:
    search network watcher
relative service :
