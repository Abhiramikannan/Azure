What is a Custom Role in Azure?
    A custom role is a user-defined role where you specify:
    Actions allowed (like Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action)
    Actions denied (optional)
    Assignable scope (which subscription/resource group it applies to)
    It's basically:
    "I want this person to do THIS, and only THIS."


Why are you creating a custom role?
    Built-in roles (like Contributor, Reader, Owner) might give too much or too little access.
    You want to give exact permissions needed for a specific task.

Example:
→ Allow user to only start/stop VMs, but not delete them.
→ Built-in roles don't give such fine control.

 So, custom roles = Granular & Controlled Access.

 practical:
    subscription ->access control ->add ->customrole -> clone a role ->Contributor
    to give access ->add permissions on top
    assign roles ->add role assignment
