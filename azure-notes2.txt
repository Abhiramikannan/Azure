services:

clusterip:
    within the cluster(ip address of cluster ip and port) -port of clusterip also same or not 
        if not give clusterip port number
    2ports:
        cluster ip port - port 
        target port :port on the application
    if target port and port are same:
                dont mention target port 
                mention only one
    selector:
        internally it will forward req to pod which has the label 
        relation ship only b/w selector and label
        if inside kubernetes cluster:
            curl clusterip:port 
                    works
    try adding target port:
        8080
        nginx listening to 80
        curl clusterip - wont work
        need to give clusterip port(nammde roominte chaavi thanne venm)
node port:
    outside the kubernetes cluster but inside ur cluster(vnet)
    in 10 machines  
        every machines that port number is reserved for that service
    3 ports:
        nodeport
        clusterip port
        target port
    nordport mentioning -not mandatory
    port -mandatory
    mention type -otherwise default is clusterip
    internally created clusterip(apply -f)
    browser: ip address:nordport(allow security group)
            edit inbound -destination:31000(Port)
loadbalancer:
    do service discovery
    distribute req to diff machines
    get the external ip
    outside ust peoples also get 
    same as nordport
        diff :type - loadbalancer
        forward load to nordport
    nodeport created from load balancer
            ip:port of nodeport
    prblm:
        each service have sep loadbalancer
        actually we dont want it
    solution:
        ingress
            path based routing -/login/somethg
             practical:
                create ingress rules and forward traffic
                whenever i give path:/ it forward to the port of service 
                internal ip: nodeport ip
                public ip: 

nginx: reverse proxy:
                inside my company-lot of servers -reverse proxy will transmit the traffic
                ssl termination
                pick up req from us and look ingress rules and do

imp:
internal loadbalancer  
    whether it is clusterip/nodeport/loadbalancer
             always done by clusterip


network policies: 
    who can talk to whom

    egress:
    whom can i talk to

    pod selector:
    app: hello

    ingress:
        -from:
            app:foo 
                means the foo can only talk to hello (anythg else try wont work)

        after getting into container execute the wget =wont work

azure:
allocate routable ip address to a service

fleet manager:
    when u want multiple kubernetes cluster

burstable nodes:
    dlte nodes when its not used

container registry:
Acr:
    like dockerhub

sidecar container:
    take care of certficate manager

istio:
    change certificate
    launching its own sep pod
    rotate certficate
    used for routing

c group:
    linux kernal features
    capture all matrix details
    configure prometheous(simple output)
    configure grafana from prometheous
    promethous can read the data and there should be a port number
    when u go to port num=everything displayed
    u can feed them in grafana
    it can help in visualizing
    pre created repos -deploy that iself -grafana standarad modifying

azure key vault:

13/5/25

when u hit hdfc bank..https checks are u valid user or not
    this process is 3 way handshake
encoding:
    use algorithm
encryption:
    use keys
    symmetric key:
         same key for    
            encrypt and decrypt

    assymetric keys:
         bank gives public key and u can encrypt 
            but u cant decrypt using that key
                 decrypt using private key(only with bank)

               problem: 
                    how will u dwld the public key -chances of man in the middle attack
                solution::
                    cerificate authority
                        they will look the certificate and validate
                problem:
                    talking to ca also talking to intermediate peoples..so it will not solve my prblm.
                solution:
                    all validated certificate preinstalled on ur browser

this is happening in case of:
                azure
                kubernetes
                microservice to microservice(istio(certificate management tool) helps-sidecar interupts the req and )
            
sidecar:
    ur main car should not be blocked (http not https)

design patterns:
    proven solution to common design problems
        eg: sidecar
            gang of four design patterns
            chain of responsibility
            strangler pattern
        problem:
            choosing the right design pattern-solution
while designing microservice:
       look upon business logic of microservice
       dapr -solved the problem of load balancing

internals of kubernetes service:
    container to container in same pod:
                     linux kernal capability -local host
                     u can create a network space
                     allocate proccess to that network space 
    2 containers in 2 diff pods in same machine: (ip address)
                    bridge-custom bride()
                    all the containers are connected to the custom brridge
                    bridge-(switch)-broadcast -use handshake signal and get mac address

    2 containers in 2 diff pods in 2 diff machines:
            communictn comes to bridge
            once it comes here it knows its not in cidr range
            goes to default root of custom bridge
                that has a default root that take to network plugin(waeve)
                this will take somehow ur msg to right machine 
                that machine also a cbr here
                that brings the msg to that container 
                each plugin is frree to implement in their own ways
        
    container to service:
        when u hit the service ip
            it is able to identfify pods in cluter ip
        req will come to cbr
        kubeproxy will pock a rule in the ip tables
            any communication on ths ip address and sent to me (proxy)
            proxy on each node talking to api server and get the list of pods asscociated with services
            what all the pods asscociated with service already in etcd. 
        do the load balancing.how?
        there is a constant communication b/w worker nodes and master
        kubeproxy will continuous get the pods asociated with  the services
        describe service to see end points
        end points(pod ip): ip address associated with services
                    change the to address to that of the clusterip(pod)ip address
                    sent it back to cbr
                    if a new pod comes up, if pod crashes -ip address removed from end point 
                    load balancing done by kubeproxy(b/w serveral instance of service done by kubeproxy)
                    kubelet sent the data to api server
        kublet continuousely run on all nodes..kublet on each node give info to api server and to etcd 
        all the kubeproxy in all nodes have same information 
        kubeproxy knows:
            pods and ip address associated to the services
        change denating
            cluster ip address chnage to pods ip address
        then comes to custom bridge




    kubelet is the only service part of the architecture
    kubectl -client to talk to api server

when we use this -we use a technology -storage classes
                                                from where the pv should come
                                                reclaimpolicy:Delete -> remove data and object when pv (refer)
kubernetes volumes:
    pv and pvc to mount the volume
    pvc and pv have 1-1 relationship
    once bound, entire pv is for pvc
    pvc is created by developer -tightly bound to pod -pod doesnt knw pv 
    pv is namespaced base
    pv:
        mention where is getting stored
    this type of allocation is called static provisioning.
    1 more type of provisioning- dynamic 
                                        create storage class
                                        how will the pv comes up -we say here
                                        when u create pvc -automatically create pv of that size
link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-csi-files-storage-provision 
created pod -mounted the same volume
got inside pod
    cd /mnt/azure/

   4 echo "volumes are working" >> vol.txt
   
   go into ur portal -> go to ur storage acc just created-> fileshares->the folder ust came here

provisioner create a pv automatically 

for bounting 3 conditions:
    req storage by pvc <=pv size
    storage class name in pv =pvc
    access mode =same

Aci: azure container instances(azure 104)
     in aws: ecs 

as compared with aks :
instaed of creating pod =creating containers where u can deploy ur image
multiple containers go together
scalability
load balancing


quickstart images:
    wont work
    need to give secrets of dockerhub

microsoft manage keys:
    key : whenever u have encrypt u have to use key
        symmetric
        asymmetric
    in this case azure needs this keys
    using: to improve the security of data running there

    eg:
        customer management key: hotel allows customer to have their own key
        hotel management key: hotel provides and customer wont have trust

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-multi-container-yaml
 Why deploy a multi-container group using a YAML file (Azure Container Instances)?
🔹 Reason:
To run multiple containers together in one isolated environment (Container Group) that can talk to each other, using a single YAML definition.
container instance vs webapp vs functionapp


aim:
    create a custom role
why u r creating?

what is cstom role?


subscription ->access control ->add ->customrole

What is a Custom Role in Azure?
    A custom role is a user-defined role where you specify:
    Actions allowed (like Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action)
    Actions denied (optional)
    Assignable scope (which subscription/resource group it applies to)
    It's basically:
    "I want this person to do THIS, and only THIS."


Why are you creating a custom role?
    Built-in roles (like Contributor, Reader, Owner) might give too much or too little access.
    You want to give exact permissions needed for a specific task.

Example:
→ Allow user to only start/stop VMs, but not delete them.
→ Built-in roles don't give such fine control.

 So, custom roles = Granular & Controlled Access.


 practical:
    subscription ->access control ->add ->customrole -> clone a role ->Contributor
    to give access ->add peermissions on top
    assign roles ->add role assignment 




creating vm with backup:

create vm and enabled backup and gave custom data for install docker(recovery service vault)
or
with json file we can create everything using azure client

or
    create recovery service vault
        deny public access 
            azure backup

manage - backup policies -add - create policy
our vault - settings -backup -configure backup

what i have done here:
    in the recovery service vault
            abhi-vault ->backup now
            


replication services:
do by myown:
replication
    disater recovery

ASG: Application Security Group
as machine increases 
        update the rules manually -not possible

create ASG -associate ASG with nics 
        whwre u permit machines only have access only talk
created insted of nsg ,so we dont need to set every machines the rules into nsg


practical:
    create vnet
        give 3 subnet -2 private
                        1 public
    create vm in each subnet
    create nsg and attach to vm

    check what are the nsg associated with subnets?
        vnet->settings->subnets
    done: dlte all vm
    create vm associated with subnet
   done: nsg->settings->subnets->associate 
   done: create vm  and while attaching security grp it will show: selected nsg already associated with the subnet


   vm-> nic ->
   nsg->attached to vnet not in vm ?
    vm->network settings ->view topology

connect to vm1
exit 

remove port 22 connection
vm->nwrk settings -> rule

try connecting:
    cant connect to vm1

go to vm2
    check nsg rules: 


machine 1 to machine 2 conection works

create asg1,2
atach the asg to vm1 and vm2(vm1 ->asg->attach)(vm2-asg-attach)
nsg->create security rule

block all vnet ->security rule on vm2->servicetag->vnet->destinationport range=*,deny ->try to connect to vm2 frm vm1 ->wont work
create asg inbound security rule-> destination:22,80,8080,443 -allow,3998->connnect-work
what we  are doing here:
    when we need to allow only particular machines to talk to other machines
    create ASG..so the vm associated with tht ASG can only talk

vm1 have asg..which allow to talk to vm2
vm2 have asg2 which allow to talk to vm3

try to connect with 3 to 2 =wont work= 3 dont have asg and in 2 we didnt set any rule(only rule asg1 can talk)


connected to vm2:
    vm2 ->nsg-> inbound rules->destination:22,80,8080,443 -allow,3998->connnect-work
    it allows evrythg from asg in vm1 to vm2

pemfile moving to vm:
    scp -i abhi-vm1_key.pem abhi-vm2_key.pem abhi@4.188.75.226:/home/abhi



FIREWALL:
link:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/tutorial-hybrid-portal
    
    while creating vnet enable firewall in security =created vnet
    create a new vm and default subnet
            inbount port rules :none 
            public ip: none 
            create
    resourcegrp->firewall u created-> private ip=note public and private ip

nsg rules are statefull:
        when u make an inbound connection,default allow outbound connection
        when u make 80,response is ok
        somebody can come frm the door,and ok to go back
        incomming req allowed,response?(ok if stateful)
firewall rules are not stateful:
    outbound is required in stateless

search route table:
    create + 
ur routetable->settings->subnets->associate
route->ip address->0.0.0.0/0->virtual appliance->next hop address=prv ip of firewall
next hop address = priv ip of firewall
rule:allow to respond to whom (route)- 3 way handshaking rule
     create a default root of 0.0.0.0/0 -so anyone can?

this is at vnet level

go to firewall->settings->rules->application rule collection->add 

firewall can define rules in multiple layers:
        application layer:
        network layer:

created application rule: to talk to external machine
                    allow me to talk to google.com but should add dns(network rule)

create network rule: for dns
        udp
        10.0.0.0/24:source =the subnet range and this should be same(everybody can talk to these 2 machines-dns)
        209.244.0.3,209.244.0.4:destination=dns
        53=destination Port
        Add

nat rule: for rdb

    Destination Ports:22
    Translated address:10.0.0.4(priv ip of vm)
    Translated port:22

try to connect to public ip of firewall:
    ssh -i abhi-vm_key\ \(2\).pem azureuser@4.213.32.56 =worked

try to curl inside vm:
    curl https://www.google.com  =worked



default root->firewall(80)->vm(3389) =we can talk
rdb =3389 =blocked in ust->cant talk
    created a linux machine and mke to talk using 22 port 
realised:
    target (destination/firewall) set to 80
    80 of firewall forward to 3389 of vm
u cant talk to application without dns,->so created network rule
nat rule: for allow remote desktop  


firewall also create a subnet
ensured vm is connected to same default vnet and subnet

 DNS ZONe:
    private DNS ZONe
        vnet links =addd vnets(multiple)
    map ur A record -> access within that vnet
vm = curl the domain name
Add record set -india -cname record(mapping domain to domain)=not for appex domain(root domain)
A-ipv4
map ip to any resource(eg:load balancer) = A record to alias

PROVISIONER:
remote executions:
    terraform provisioner feature
    similar to custom data
    custom data is the azures cloud provider feature

    link: https://github.com/vilasvarghese/terraform-tutorial/blob/master/azure/23_provisioner/main.tf
not happening in the control of terraform
so dont use provisioners
remote-exec: Executes commands inside your VM (or any remote resource you’re managing, like a virtual machine or server).

local exec:
local-exec: Executes commands on your local machine (the machine where Terraform is running).
    do the remote executions
    file will be in locally
    should be available in cloud shell
    link: https://github.com/vilasvarghese/terraform-tutorial/tree/master/3k_provisioner

    only use these lines in the above code:
     provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "sudo echo ${self.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt"
     }

service principles
    users -roles changes
    refer notes

3 diff category of service principles:
    1.  legacy
    2.  ext entity(terrafom) can talk to azure and execute things by creating service principles
    all service connection attached to service principles
    service principle get access to do those operations(becauseu havae ownership)
    u dont want to login to acr while pushing because of service connection u r creating and the service principle have that role

   3. managed identities
        when 1 of the azure resource want to talk to another resource 
        u dont have to embed any userid/certificate
        it gets a token from AD and have the permission to talk with



register an app and api and give access to that things and all

docker-k8s/blob/master/.github/workflows/docker-image.yaml

sla -b/w company and customer within year
    if we are not able to meet this,will pay back




sre -site relialiable engineer
    u will be questioned if company needs to pay
    mostly on production side

test integration: 



feature flag:
    make the changes in the code
    if u deploy also people cannot see
    QA was delaying things ->taking time to test
    code is there not available for customers
    when u deploy somethg -consumed later by customers
    n number of microservices,each microservice do diff works, the teams which are completing the feature include in the code 
    if other teams are not done...deploy to production but not available to customer until the feature plan enabled

1.data disk:
    not bootable disk
    external disk
    machine can continue to work without it
    if we need to migrate the data disk from 1 vm to another -> detach the disk first
    and attach to next vm

2. deploy vms using arm template and all vms in single availabilty set..
    u want to make sure the many vms as possible remain accesible in the event of fabric 
    failure?
    ans: max value

3. platformFaultDomainCount:3(max)
    updatedomaincount: 20(max value)

4. current vm should referee to adinistrative password ... then?password->encrypted?
    ans: keyvault,access policy(rbac)

5. You're in a hybrid Azure AD + on-prem AD environment.
    VMs are running on Windows Server 2012 R2 Hyper-V (on-prem).
    You're using PowerShell scripts to automate VM configuration.
    You're about to create many new VMs.

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern used to separate read operations (queries) from write operations (commands) in an application.

site to site vpn:
    azure create a vpn gateway(need subnet with all enabled)
    also create lan in azure(representing the on premise)
    we are specificying ip and range 


Branching startegy:
    release Branch and scrum team will test using testcases 
    2 types of strategy:
        1. Trunk based strategy
        2. Git lab flow

1. Trunk based Strategy:
    only 1 single branch always ready to release
    people will create feature branch and merge
    not completely done things can be merged from feature branch to main and to production now
    here feature flag came to picture 
    only relased things have feature flag on others off ->but problem
    problem: cant manage easily
            these transactions(push,pull req,someone reviw and merged) are very short lived(lessthan a day)
            multiple times people will merging
            when u reduce the duration->chances of merge conflict reduced
            because only small incremental changes going into a branch
            1. without proper testig things are going
                    solution: proper automated test
                            but not every flow u can test and many companies testing strategies are not good,testcases missed
                            here Gates come into picture
                                coverage num >80
                                unit test case coverage more closer
    solution: Devops engineer can do
                because sometimes companies sla and all go into problem





2. Git lab flow:
    addition to git hub flow

    u would create diff branch for diff envt eg: develop,stage,dev 
    envt based branches:
        dev
        stage
        develop
    completely independent features u have
    but once it go to stage/merge:
        staging is more production like 
        things are properly evaluated
        whenevr u merge -> pipeline will come

        this is much more organised
        if u make mistake it can be caught
        this is more practical

    here we are eliminating manual testing
    even developers themselves will write testcases
    quality is like higher level of maintaining automation framework
    testcase can automatically modify when developer make changee 

    wht do the auto test engineers do?
        they will write integrating test cases by selenium and all
        development engineers write the testcase without end users concepts
    
    1 developer write and another developer write the testcases(good practice)

Drawbacks of git lab flow:
    slowing the process and maintain multiple branches
    always increasing complexity
    compare with traditional flow:
            when u do cd u may break things in production so we have fail forward
                    fail forward:
                        no shift left option
                        roll forward
                            immediately come and fix it and move forward

installing agents- azure
agent-collect the data
store data in log analytics workspace

data collection rule: the data stored in this workspace
app insight=tracking application(aks cluster),metrix-where data will come by default
app insight =internally install the agents and push to log analytics workspace
it shows chart (99 percentile somethg)

azure arc init: install (to store data in log analytics)
kql=kusto querry language
to see the data =create dashboard


practical: creating log analytics workspace

creating aks cluster?

 promethous can read the data and there should be a port number
    when u go to port num=everything displayed
    u can feed them in grafana
    it can help in visualizing
    pre created repos -deploy that iself -grafana standarad modifying what about azure if we  are doing in azure?

aks cluster creation
log analytics creation
after aks creation=we can enable insights there itself
aks cluster->monitor->insights->click warnings->this shows kql querry->click + and type ur own querry and execute
agent:
vm->insights->performance->performace diagnostics
vm->alerts->create alert rule-> threshhold=5-> actions->new action rule create->
notification type->2nd one->
action-type-> nill
create

vm ->insights->top n charts
this is agents ..which sents to log analytics workspace
